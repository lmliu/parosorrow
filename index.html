          In later 21st century, the world has succumbed to climate change with increasing temperatures and rapid disappearance of Arctic ice caps. However, the fight for implementing mental healthcare has won and mental health is now recognized as an important facet of healthiness. Animal rights movement also won and non-human species are now given the same rights as human species. These two aspects combined allow for this represented world where seals are given the same mental and physical health treatment as other species.

            Paro the Seal was engineered by AIST, a leading Japanese industrial automation pioneer in 2003. By late 21st century, Paro has been upgraded multiple times to be qualified as a doctor in psychological health (we will refer to them as therapists throughout this project). Its original abilities which are supported by tactile, light, audition, temperature, and posture sensors are now supplemented by the visualization of emotion in the form of colors, ability to speak to seals, as well as the ability to improve itself and increase its therapeutic abilities through experience (ie. Paro can learn more than patterns of treatment). Paro works with ill seals by using emotion detection and offering aid in the form of sound, warmth, touch, and speech.

            With our three precedents, we create a world in which each works in harmony to induce greater automation as a result of greater equity. We use diverse artifacts to display this world including: art, writing, and physical object. The inclusion of the zine reflects the increasing abilities of Paro as a therapist in his expression of his experiences in the Biosphere. The poems are created by Paro in his understanding of the patients’ experiences and created in the form of a zine based on the culture inspired by self-expression.

          The zine is a 4-page flip book of poems written by Paro in based on its experience within the Biosphere in which it works. It is written in the poetic form of Rupi Kaur, a poet in the 21st century who wrote poems solely based on expression of emotion.
